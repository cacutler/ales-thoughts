                <p>Because of what I learned with family history during my service mission (see the <a href="mission_life.html">Mission Life page</a> for more information), I started to love doing family history work.</p>
                <p>Over the past year, I actually got called to be a ward temple and family history consultant in my YSA ward and I have been asked to lead a couple of family history classes, both in my ward and at the institute.  With those responsibilities, I have been somewhat working on upkeeping my family history skill set and I am glad for it.</p>

                <p>Since I have a passion for learning about technology and software, I have decided to dedicate this page to listing some of my reviews and thoughts on some of the current technology and software available, specifically Apple software and technology, but I can/will review other technology and software.</p>
                <div id="applelogohero"></div>
                <h3>Apple Reviews</h3>
                <p>Let's start off with Apple's latest software, specifically iOS and iPadOS 15 and watchOS 8.  When iOS and iPadOS 15 were first made public, I didn't love some of the design features, specifically with the notification design, but it has started growing on me.  As for the new Safari design on iOS and iPadOS, I actually like it.  The new multitasking features on iPadOS 15 also looked, and still looks, a smidge weird for me since I am used to the typical multitasking features of the OS.  With the new FaceTime features, even though I don't use FaceTime that much, I love how Apple basically brought FaceTime up to the rest of the competition like Zoom and Google Meet.  I also really like the Focus modes Apple brought to DND and I use them all the time.</p>
                <p>With watchOS 8, I felt like it was more of a medicore update to watchOS compared to previous updates.  I do like how Apple brought all of the main Find My features to the Apple Watch though.  I also like the improvements they made with the Messages app and content sharing.</p>
                <p>With their hardware, I currently use an iPhone 13 Pro, a couple of the basic iPads, and an Apple Watch Series 6.  I really love the iPhone 13 Pro and Apple Watch Series 6 and how they integrate together.  I used to have an iPhone 8 Plus and when I upgraded to the 13 Pro, it felt so much faster.  Granted I used the 8 Plus for 4 years.  I really like the integration Apple has with all of their software and hardware products and it feels good moving from device to device.  A good part of how I use these devices really helps me with my schooling, particularly with note-taking and uploading assignments.</p>
                <h3>Other Tech Reviews</h3>
                <p>Besides using my apple devices for school and normal daily use, I use a Windows laptop to do a lot of my coding and writing for college.  I like using it, especially in combination with Windows 11.  I really like user interface of the OS since it feels a little reminiscent of MacOS even though I never used a Mac on a daily basis.  I do want to switch over to MacOS sometime in the future as I learn more programming languages, specifically Swift and SwiftUI (Apple programming languages).  For now though, I'm happy with my current laptop.</p>

                <p>I currently attend college at Utah Tech University located in St. George, Utah, studying Software Engineering.  I have taken some concurrent enrollment courses in high school with UTU, so I am technically a college sophomore at the time of writing this.</p>
                <h3>Current Classes</h3>
                <p>My current college classes include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>English 2100 - Technical Writing</li>
                    <li>Math 2050 - Applied Statistics with Programming</li>
                    <li>IT 1100 - Introduction to Linux/Unix</li>
                    <li>CS 2420 - Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
                    <li>CS 2810 - Computer Organization and Architecture</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Former Classes</h3>
                <p>Some of my former college classes including the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Math 1210 - Calculus I: This was my first college math class since I took AP Calculus in high school and managed to pass the ap test with a 3 so I was able to get into Calc I without much difficulty.  Since I took AP Calc in high school, the material in Calculus I came much easier to me than the material in Calculus II.</li>
                    <li>English 1010 - Introduction to Writing: Like Calculus I, this was my first college english and, in my opinion, it felt more difficult than English 2010 or even my AP Literature class that I took in high school.</li>
                    <li>CS 1400 - Functional Programming: I felt this class was somewhat easy since it was an introductory course to the Python language.  There were some coding assignments that were difficult but I ultimately liked it.</li>
                    <li>Biology 1610 & 1615 - Principles of Biology I and it's corresponding lab: I liked this class in that most of the "homework" in it was just studying for tests and quizzes.  I also liked the genetics and DNA units that was covered during the class.</li>
                    <li>English 2010 - Interim Writing: I consider english to be one of my weakest, if not my weakest, subject in school, mainly because I haven't been super great at writing, but with my college english classes like this one, I have gotten much better.</li>
                    <li>Math 1220 - Calculus II: Many students have said Calculus II was the hardest calculus class they have taken and I would have to agree with them.  Calc II is the hardest math class I have taken since a lot of the concepts are hard to figure out when they are put into practice.</li>
                    <li>CS 1410 - Object Oriented Programming: I have gotten to really like this class because of what I was able to accomplish with the coding I learned during the course of the class.  Plus, I think coding looks really cool.</li>
                    <li>SE 1400 - Web Design: Like with CS 1410, I have been liking this class because of the coding I have learned and seeing the end result of the coding I have done.  This class was also my first fully online course ever and I like being able to do everything at home but, at the same time, I wish I could've met everyone in person.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also take institute classes and I enjoy spending time at the campus institute of religion when I am on campus but not attending class or receiving help from tutors on various assignments.</p>
